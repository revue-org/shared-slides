## Event Storming

In order to create a better understanding of the domain, we used the Event Storming technique. We performed the following steps:

1. **Unstructured exploration**: the goal is to identify the main events
2. **Timeline**: the events are ordered in time
3. **Pivotal events & pain points**: discussion about critical point that require attention and reasoning on events that have impact on the domain.
4. **Actors, Commands, Policies and Read Models**
5. **Aggregates**: groping of event into aggregates
6. **Bounded contexts**: identification of bounded contexts based on aggregates interaction
